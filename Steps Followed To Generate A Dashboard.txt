1. Download The Dataset "Space_Mission.csv"
2. Load The data Into PowerBI as csv file
3. Transform The Data
	1. Check For The Data Types
	2. Check For The Null Values (If exists remove them)
4. Make Date Table using New_Table For The Date Hierachie.
		Date Table = ADDCOLUMNS(CALENDAR( MIN('Space Missions'[Date]), MAX('Space Missions'[Date])),
						"Year", YEAR([Date]), "Month", FORMAT([Date], "mmm"), "Month Number", MONTH([Date]))
5. Make A separate table using "Enter Data" with the Name "All Measures".
6. Create First Measure "Total Missions" (To COUNT the unique missions throughout the year)
		Total Missions = COUNT('Space Missions'[Mission])
7. Use "Line Chart" To See The Mission Trend of the year.
	x-axis = year, y-axis = Total Missions, Legend=Mission Status
8. Most Successful Missions By the Companies (Only Successful). Create A Measure "Successful Missions".
		Successful Missions = CALCULATE(COUNT('Space Missions'[Mission]), 'Space Missions'[Mission] = "Success")
9. Use "Bar Chart" To See The Successful Missions By the Companies.
	x-axis = Successful Missions, y-axis = Companies
10. Use "Bar Chart" To See The Missions By the Rocket.
	x-axis = Total Missions, y-axis = Rocket, format the bar by conditions rocket is "Active" or "Not Active"
11. New Measure "Total Price"
		Total Price = SUM('Space Missions'[Price])
12. Use "Scatter Plot" 
	Value = Location, X_Axis = Total Missions, Y_Axis = Total Price, Legen = Mission Status, Size = Sccessful Missions
13. Use "Donut Chart"
	Legend = Mission Status, Values = Total Missions
14. Now Add The "KPIs" by using "Card(New)"
	1. Failed Missions (Measures), Comma Separated
	2. Partial Failure (Measures), Comma Separated
	3. Prelaunch Failure (Measures), Comma Separated
	4. Successful Missions (Measures), Comma Separated
	5. Total Missions (Measures), Comma Separated
	6. Total Price (Measures), Comma Separated, $ Sign
